Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)\n","\n","* Search `board` sequentially (in row-major order) for `word[0]`.\n","* Then search depth-first for the rest of the word. That is,\n","\t* From the cell containing `word[0]`, we pick any of the four possible paths (here, we first try the left cell; see line 12.) and *first* go as *deep* as possible along that path.\n","\t* If that doesn't result in a succesful search, we try the other paths (one after the other).\n","\t* `w` is used to index into `word`. As `w` scans `word`, we go deeper in our exploration.\n","\t* The `word` is found when each letter in `word` has been succesfully searched, i.e., when `w == len(word)` (line 8).\n","\t* The `or` condition takes care that once a `search` has returned true we don't search anymore.\n","\t* To ensure that within a search a letter cell is used only once, we mark it `None` as we go deeper in our search, and \"unmark\" it, i.e., mark it back to its original letter, when *backtracking*-- reverting to a prior position for having gone along the wrong (which you can only realize later) path.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ImqS9vWl36fA"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qKuDN58Pubm3"},"outputs":[],"source":["class Solution:\n","    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:\n","        rows = len(board)\n","        cols = len(board[0])\n","        word_len = len(word)\n","        \n","        def search(r, c, w):\n","            if w == word_len: return True\n","            if not (0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols): return False            \n","            if board[r][c] != word[w]: return False                        \n","            board[r][c] = None            \n","            found = search(r, c-1, w+1) or\\\n","                    search(r-1, c, w+1) or\\\n","                    search(r, c+1, w+1) or\\\n","                    search(r+1, c, w+1)\n","            board[r][c] = word[w]\n","            return found\n","            \n","        \n","        for r in range(rows):\n","            for c in range(cols):\n","                found = search(r, c, 0)\n","                if found: return True\n","        return False"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**A couple of optimizations:**\n","* Check if the letters of the word exist in the board first.\n","* If the frequency of the word's first letter is greater than the last letter's, then reverse the word.
